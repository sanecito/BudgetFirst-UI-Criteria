## Table of Contents

(TODO: Run a script to generate this later)

## Overview
This is a collaborative repo to harden the UI (wireframes, logo, etc) of the BudgetFirst project while the architecture and frameworks are hardened and chosen. To engage with other aspects of the BudgetFirst project, please check [/r/budgetfirst](https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfirst/) for community forums, the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/budget-first) to request to join the contributor discussions on [Slack](https://budgetfirst.slack.com) and project management on [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/project/urbanhusky-budget-first/), or the eventual code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/BudgetFirst/BudgetFirst)!


## UI Element Guidelines

The following is a work in progress and will be carried out in several steps for each UI element:
1. Note primary dos/do nots as given by platform authorities (Apple, Google, etc)
2. Condense primary list into a universal set of mandatory guidelines
3. Create secondary criteria list driven by contributor conversation (e.g. logo themes)

### Logo

The logo should be designed to be platform ambiguous. In other words the logo appearance should be the same across PC and mobile platforms with little to no alternations across said platforms.

### Wireframes

Wireframes should focus on handling the general use cases and making general case use as simple as possible so as to encourage adoption and retention.
